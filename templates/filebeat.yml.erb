###################### Filebeat Configuration Template #########################

# File template file for use in the cb_vra_iaas cookbook

#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================
filebeat.inputs:

# Chef log files
- type: log
  enabled: true

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  paths:
    # Chef Client Log
    - c:\chef\client.log
    # Chef StackTrace log, for errors
    - c:\chef\cache\chef-stacktrace.out

  # Optional additional fields. These fields can be freely picked
  # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
  #fields:
  #  level: debug
  #  review: 1

  ### Multiline options
  # Since stacktrace.out tends to generate multi-line outputs, we need to turn this on

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  #multiline.pattern: ^\[
  # multiline.pattern: '^Generated at 20[0-9][0-9]-[0-1][0-9]-[0-3][0-9] [0-2][0-9]:[0-6][0-9]:[0-6][0-9] +[0-2][0-9]00'

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  #multiline.negate: false
  # multiline.negate: true

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  # multiline.match: after
